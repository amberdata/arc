# ARC
Open Source Repository for Asset Reference & Classification Data

## What is ARC?

Asset Reference and Classification (ARC) is an institutional-grade security master database for digital assets that aims to provide a transparent and robust approach to the digital asset market to promote effective regulation, alignment, innovation, and risk mitigation. As the first open-source digital asset standard, ARC enables institutions to keep accurate records of highly dynamic digital assets across various dimensions. ARC contains reference and categorization details about a digital asset, such as asset names and addresses across blockchains, exchanges it trades on, spot and derivatives instruments of the asset, instrument contract specifications, and use cases.
